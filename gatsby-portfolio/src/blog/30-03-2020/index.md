# My Journey With JavaScript

### 30th March 2020

<p>
Hello From Sunder Nagar. Thats rights, I have been living in my home town - Sunder Nagar for queite some days now since the whole country suddenly shut down due to the pandemic. Live is quite nice here in mountains. Its been like week or so since the first Janta Curfew happened, and it wasn't long before I realised this was gonna be one heck of a long vacation. So while the world went to Sh*t outside, I was packed in my house with all this free time and nothing to do. 
Now a thing about me is, <b>I cannot sit free.</b> I always have this itch to do something.

On one such day, I was scrolling through YouTube and this video popped up in my recomendation.
